# store-management-api-testing-using-postman
This project, Store Management – API Testing with Postman, focuses on validating the backend APIs of a Store Management System using Postman. It covers essential modules such as user authentication, product management, inventory/stock handling, billing, and reporting. The aim is to ensure that each REST API endpoint works correctly by testing request methods, responses, status codes, and error handling. All CRUD operations—including adding, updating, deleting, and viewing products—are tested along with stock updates, bill creation, and user login verification. Postman collections, environment variables, and test scripts are used to organize and automate the testing workflow, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and reliability across different scenarios. This README provides an overview of the API testing process and helps developers understand how the store management system’s backend has been validated.
